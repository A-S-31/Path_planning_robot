What are Mobile Robots?

Mobile robots are machines capable of moving through an environment to perform tasks without being fixed in one position. Unlike robotic arms or stationary systems, mobile robots are designed to navigate physical space—wheeled, legged, or flying—and are often used in applications where flexibility, adaptability, or autonomous movement is important.
In simple terms:
A mobile robot is a robot that can move and interact with its surroundings, usually using wheels, tracks, or legs. It senses its environment, makes decisions (often based on programming or AI), and moves accordingly.
Key Characteristics:
Mobility: Ability to move in 2D or 3D space.


Autonomy: Often designed to operate with minimal human input.


Perception: Uses sensors (like cameras, lidar, sonar, or GPS) to understand its environment.


Control: Includes systems for planning, decision-making, and motion control.


Types of Mobile Robots:
Wheeled Robots (like your differential drive robot)


Legged Robots (like quadrupeds or humanoids)


Aerial Robots (drones)


Underwater Robots


Autonomous Vehicles (self-driving cars)


Applications:
Warehouse automation (e.g., Amazon robots)


Search and rescue


Military and surveillance


Agriculture


Service and delivery robots


Research and education

Obstacle Avoiding Mobile Robot (Differential Drive)
This project is a differential drive mobile robot capable of autonomous navigation with obstacle avoidance. It was developed as part of a university course on Mobile Robots. The system combines real-time obstacle detection using an ultrasonic sensor with basic path planning done in MATLAB. A Raspberry Pi 4B controls the hardware, including the motors (via an L298N driver), and a caster wheel provides stability at the front.
Key Components:
Raspberry Pi 4B – runs the control logic and interfaces with sensors


Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) – detects nearby obstacles


L298N Motor Driver – powers and controls the two DC motors


2 DC Motors – drive the differential motion


Caster Wheel – balances the front of the robot


Features:
Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance


Basic path planning performed in MATLAB


Smooth navigation using differential drive


Expandable hardware and modular code



Getting Started
Hardware Setup


Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins.


Wire the DC motors to the L298N motor driver and connect it to the Pi.


Use an external battery pack or USB-C for power.


Path Planning (MATLAB)


The path planning algorithm was developed and simulated in MATLAB.


You can modify the MATLAB scripts for different environments or export paths for integration into the Python code.



Future Improvements
Integrate MATLAB-generated paths directly with the control system


Upgrade obstacle detection using additional sensors or vision


Add real-time mapping for dynamic environments
